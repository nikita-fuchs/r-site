            <h4>3.1 Google Analytics</h4>
            <p class="sub-heading">
                On our website we use Google Analytics a web analysis service of Google LLC. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, "Google").
                Google Analytics enables the generation of statistics to help us understand website traffic and its sources. We use Google Analytics solely for
                statistical purposes, such as to track how many users have clicked on a particular item or information. As a company based in Germany, our legal
                basis is Art. 6 (1) f) DSGVO in conjunction with § 15 para. 3 German Federal Telemedia Act (TMG). The retention period of the cookie is 2 years.
                Google Analytics is based on cookies and records information about your use of our website including your IP address. To prevent users being
                identified by their IP addresses, we use a special code to ensure that your IP address is recorded solely in truncated and therefore anonymized
                form. It is no longer possible to identify individual users with this truncated IP address. Further information on data protection when using Google
                Analytics can be found under the following link: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2700409?hl=en&ref_topic=2611283" target="_blank">

            <p class="sub-heading">
                We use Google AdWords and Google AdWords Conversion of Google to measure the efficiency of individual ads, offers and functions. A cookie is placed as soon as you

                within the cookie's validity of 30 days. The information obtained by the conversion cookie is for compiling conversion statistics for AdWords customers who opted
                for conversion tracking. We gain information on the total number of users who clicked on an ad and were forwarded to a website with a conversion tracking tag.

                On our website we use the Google Tag Manager of Google, which is used to trigger tags that we manage through an interface. The Tag Manager tool itself
                (which implements the tags) works without the use of cookies and does not collect personal data. However, the tool triggers other tags that may collect
                personal data. Google Tag Manager does not access such data. As a company based in Germany, our legal basis is Art. 6 (1) f) DSGVO in conjunction with § 15 para.
                3 TMG. If a deactivation has been made at domain or cookie level, it will remain in effect for all tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager.

            <p class="sub-heading">
                Google Dynamic Remarketing is a service provided by Google. Our website uses a pixel which establishes a connection to Google servers. Information transmitted to
                Google for example includes that you have visited our website. Google associates this information with an ID that is stored on your device in the form of a cookie
                or is provided by your device. If you visit other websites also using Google Dynamic Remarketing, this information will be linked to your pseudonymous ID. As a
                company based in Germany, our legal basis is Art. 6 (1) f) DSGVO in conjunction with § 15 para. 3 TMG. However, it is not clear to us which other websites you
                visit. We can also provide our websites with so-called "re-marketing tags". This means that we include keywords in our website that contain statements about the
                content of the page displayed (such as product or service categories). The keywords we use do not contain any personally identifiable information. Google receives
                and stores these keywords for the above-mentioned recognition features. If you visit a page that we have identified with a specific product category, Google will
                store the respective keyword and associate it with your recognition characteristics. The processed data is stored for a period of two years.

            <p class="sub-heading">
                We use Twitter Conversion Tracking, Twitter Advertising and Twitter Analytics provided by Twitter, Inc. (1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco,

                These tools enable us to recognize when a user clicks on a link on our Twitter posts, retweets, marks something with "Like" or simply sees the tweet
                and subsequently visits the RISE-website. We can see which actions you perform as a user on our website (e.g. visit website, register for newsletter, download).
                The website tag is triggered and the conversion data is recorded. We can then compile a list of similar users and use it as a target group for future marketing
                campaigns. These Twitter tools also enable us to target visitors to our website with targeted advertising. For this Twitter uses a code snippet (tag), which we
                have integrated on our website. "Tailored Audiences" is also used to create look-a-like targeting lists. A conversion is recorded for a period of 30 days and
                then deleted. Other statistical information is deleted after a period of 2 years.
